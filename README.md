# React version of my Portfolio

## Future update ideas:

Github API to dynamically get pinned projects from github and add them to the projects section slideshow of my portfolio

Start to record daily temperature data and display the data on a graph with D3

Add other sensors around my home and incorporate more arduino/raspberry pi projects

Add a blog tab to explain the process through working on each of my new projects

### Other ideas when they come to me
